A Document Object Model or DOM is a version of the site that the user accesses and manipulates. It is like a printed copy of a paper document
that the receiver is allowed to modify as they see fit. The DOM is also able to correct the errors of an html page automatically by finding missing
elements and adding them for example. The DOMs purpose is to run the site smoothly and easily for the user by breaking off from the source code to
fit the users needs as best as possible.
